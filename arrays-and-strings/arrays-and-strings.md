## Arrays and Strings

* [1.1 Is Unique:]() Implment and algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
* [1.2 Check Permutation:]() Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is permutation of other.
* [1.3 URLify:]() Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
```
Input: "Mr John Smith      ", 13
Output: "Mr%20%John%20%Smith"
```

* [1.4 Palindrome Permutation:]() Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
```
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
